    // 1.immutable list : This list cannot change after creation
    // 2 . mutable list : This list can modified after creation

    // for example
    val immutable_list= listOf("data1","Data2","Data3")
    val mutable_list= mutableListOf<Double>(2.5,6.7,8.9,9.9)
    print(mutable_list)

    // which we can do some calculation
    // 1. to Store more than one data into a single variable
    // 2. We get different method like add,remove
    // 3. To create dynamic fication of kotlin sets.
